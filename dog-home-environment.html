	<p>Dogs are pack animals and they feel happy when they are with their family. Dogs like things a little different from people, though, and I'll tell you how.</p>
	<p>Dogs need a comfortable, dry place to rest. They also need a few places to hide. They like wide open areas with lots of trees to pee on.  If you have more than one dog, like me, than take this advice: you <strong>MUST</strong> keep them from fighting. Trust me, I've seen it, it's not pretty.</p>
	<p>Dogs can overheat, quickly.  They have thick fur coats and cannot sweat to cool off.  Leaving a dog in a hot car is illegal in some places.  It should be illegal everywhere.  The temperature in a closed car can quickly rise 30 or more degrees higher than the outside air.  If it's 90 degrees outside, <a href="http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2014/05/dog-dies-after-being-left-in-hot-car.php">that's deadly!</a>  </p>
	<p class="quote">On an 85-degree day, for example, the temperature inside a car with the windows opened slightly can reach 102 degrees within 10 minutes. After 30 minutes, the temperature will reach 120 degrees.  <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/pets_safe_heat_wave.html">humanesociety.org</a></p>
