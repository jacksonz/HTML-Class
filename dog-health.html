	<h1>Why is dog health important?</h1>
	<img src="images/dog_question.jpg" style="float:left"/>
	<p>Dog health is the most important thing in owning a dog.  If your dog isn't healthy, they won't be happy and you won't enjoy owning a sad, depressed or sick dog.  Healthy dogs live longer and cost less to keep healthy.</p>
